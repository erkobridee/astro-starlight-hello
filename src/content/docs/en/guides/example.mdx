Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <Image
    src={gearSvgImage}
    alt="gear image"
    width={200}
    class="p-2 dark:bg-white"
  />
</div>
